    "# Comparison of Road Profiles for Fatigue and Damage Load Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to merge and compare three recorded road profiles to analyze fatigue and damage loads. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.\n",
    "2. **Load Road Profile Data**: Load the data from the three recorded road profiles.\n",
    "3. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in the correct format for merging and analysis.\n",
    "4. **Merge Data**: Combine the three road profiles into a single dataset for comparison.\n",
    "5. **Perform Fatigue and Damage Load Analysis**: Use appropriate methods to analyze the fatigue life and damage loads based on the merged data.\n",
    "6. **Visualize Results**: Plot the results of the analysis to compare the fatigue and damage loads across the different road profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you will be able to assess and compare the fatigue and damage loads experienced by the Husky A200 robot on different road profiles."
